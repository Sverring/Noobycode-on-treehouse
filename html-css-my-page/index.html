    <h2>Kamina</h2>

    </div>
    
    <div class='right-position col'>
    <p class='text-border'>At first glance, Kamina is boisterous, hotheaded and arrogant. He demands recognition and seems hungry for greatness, illustrated in his tendency to call himself "the Mighty Kamina" and his signature catchphrase, "Just who the Hell do you think I am?!" He is an undeterred idealist, often to the point of ignorance; Yoko has described him as "a man of unlimited stupidity." Kamina is also very perverted, declaring that the urge to stare at beautiful women is the definition of a man.</p>

  <h2>Simon</h2>

    </div>
    
  <div class='left-position col'>
    <p class='text-left text-border'> Earlier in the series, Simon was underdeveloped for his age so he was quite short, shorter than even Nia, Rossiu and Yoko, all of the same age group. At age 14, he stood at approximately 5 feet, and was not as defined compared to the rest of the men in the brigade. He had a lightly tanned baby face which may have not been so bad, was it not for the rest of his body which made him look younger than he actually was. This, as a man, was much to his chagrin. Despite this, his attractive features were still noticed by some women.</p>

   <h2>Eko Littner</h2>

     </div>
     
    <div class='right-position col'>
    <p class='text-right text-border'>Yoko is shown to be very mature and quite knowledgeable. Yoko is a kind and caring person, but can be aggressive sometimes, particularly when dealing with Kamina. Yoko is a person who can handle most situations very well. She is also known be very good at fighting with her rifle and confident in her abilities.Unlike Kamina, Yoko prefers to think things through before charging head-first into a battle, and is easily the most rational member of the group along with Rossiu and, initially, Simon. Yoko is also shown to be a very protective person, and cares deeply for her team mates and friends. Despite calling Kamina a man of unlimited stupidity, she found herself falling in love with him.</p>

    <h2>Nia Teppelin</h2>
    <img src='img/nia.jpg' width=600 height=350 alt='nia-appearance'>
    </div>
    
    <div class='left-position col'>
    <p class='text-left text-border'>Nia is a sweet, kind and caring girl by nature. She always likes people to be happy and is highly empathetic to others, especially Simon. She naturally tried to help Simon when he was distressed over Kamina's death, saying that he isn't helpless on his own and shouldn't be so dependent on Kamina, but ends up upsetting a heart-broken Yoko to the point where she shouted at her and stormed off. She is never intentionally mean and almost always has a smile on her face even when she was fading away in the last episode of the series.</p>
